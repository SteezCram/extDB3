# extDB3
I have created this repository as an archive to download extDB3, since the repository was closed by bitbucket https://bitbucket.org/torndeco/extdb3/. But now I started to maintain this actively, if anyone want to help me feel free to make an issue or make a pull request 😉!

A x64 version for Linux is now available! 

I released a new version for Windows that changes small things in the library. The new version will be available soon for Linux.

# Description

The main purpose for extDB3 is for persistent missions in Arma.
Note it will require some knowledge about SQF & SQL to use.
extDB3 is also designed to be flexible & secure at the same time.
